## notes
Creating a One Page website about the "Impact of Bushfire" was a worthwhile project, especially considering that areas such as Australia are often affected by severe forest fires. For this project I chose to use HTML, CSS and JavaScript, as well as the Bootstrap framework, to create an attractive image rotation effect for the site. Here are some of my thoughts and reflections on this project:

Using the Bootstrap framework throughout the project provided a ready-made structure and style for the website, which allowed me to focus on the design of the content and the user experience.Bootstrap's grid system allowed the website to display well on a variety of devices and made it easy to create a responsive design.

Image rotation is one of the highlights of my site, with rotating code written in JavaScript I was able to display a series of images about Bushfire's influences. This interactive approach allows users to better understand the environmental and social impact of Bushfire by simply clicking or swiping through the images.

I also used CSS to customize the styling of the rotation, including transition effects, font choices, and color schemes to ensure that the overall look was consistent with the theme. This helped the site look more appealing while also communicating the message better.

In terms of the content of the site, I collected a variety of images of Bushfire through the provided website, including fire scenes, victims, and rescue operations. Through these images, I tried to convey the wide-ranging impact of Bushfire on life, nature, and society. Each image is accompanied by a short caption to help users better understand the story behind the image.

Overall, this project not only allowed me to improve my proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but it also allowed me to think more deeply about the impact of an important topic. By designing this website, I hope to raise awareness of the Bushfire problem and convey the serious threat it poses to life and the environment. I believe that through the internet and strong visual communication, we can better draw attention to the issue and push for measures to minimize these impacts and protect our planet and society.

Using the Bootstrap framework as the design framework for the rotator chart serves several important purposes: first, it ensures that the rotator chart displays well on the website and on different kinds of devices. Its responsive design ensures that the rotator charts maintain a consistent appearance and functionality across various screen sizes and devices, providing a better experience.

Secondly, the code inside the Bootstrap framework helps to minimize errors and problems. It ensures that the rotational charts in the website are not interrupted by code errors, thus ensuring smooth functioning of the website.
